/*  
    Create an object called `pizza` that has 6 properties: 
        - name (string)
        - price (number)
        - category (string)
        - popularity (number)
        - rating (number)
        - tags (array of strings)

    Make sure that you give your properties values of the correct data type.

    Note: the category is something like appetizer/entree, the popularity is an overall ranking, the rating is an average of 
    all customer ratings, and for the tags, think of things that a user might filter by, like 'gluten-free' or 'kids'

console.log(`Problem 5:`)

/* 
    Now let's write a function that's a little more flexible than just 
    filtering for one value. We want to be able to filter for food that 
    has above a certain rating, below a certain price, or any other combo.

    Write a function called `filterByProperty` that takes in 
    three arguments: `property`, `number`, and `type`. 

    The property will be a string (rating, popularity, or price)
    The number will be the number that you want to compare against 
    The type should be 'above' or 'below' to indicate whether 
    you want to get foods with values that are above or below 
    the given number for the given property

    Inside the function, create a variable to hold a filtered array

    Use the filter method to filter the foodArr

        In the callback, check if the `type` is `above`, 
        if it is, return objects whose value for the given
        property is greater than the `number` passed in

        If the type isn't `below`, return objects whose value for the 
        given property is less than the `number` passed in
    
    Return the filtered array from the entire function
